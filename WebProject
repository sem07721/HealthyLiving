<p>In "How Not to Die", a health book discussing the negative impact a poor diet can have on quality of life and lifespan, Dr. Greger provides a "Daily Dozen" checklist of the foods that all people should be eating everyday to prevent disease. You can view this list by clicking on the link below.
I have created a sample meal plan for three days using this list for anyone concerned with how to get these 12 foods everyday</p>
