	<tr><td><p><h3>The Power of Antioxidants</h3>
	<p>What are antioxidants?</p>
	<p>Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Antioxidants are found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. </p>
	<p>Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases.</p>
